Subject Alpha State Machine: 


The AI immediately goes into a chase state when the first fuse is grabbed. The flee state is triggered in contact with the raycast of the UV light, which then transitions into a patrol state. In the patrol state, it visits a random waypoint and idles when it gets there, after the idle period it patrols to a new waypoint. Alpha will chase based on line of sight when patrolling or idling, it can also chase if it hasnt been in chase for a random range (its 25-35 seconds).


Subject Beta State Machine: 


The AI begins in a roaming state that navigates to random waypoints when its in a certain range of a waypoint itll go to a different one. If a sound is loud enough, it will chase and kill the player. Otherwise, sounds that arenâ€™t dangerously loud will cause an investigative state where it crawls to the audio source sniff the area. Then it will return to patrolling. 


Save system:


Any settings that you change will be saved to JSON and will be loaded as soon as you relaunch the game. Going to menu and back to game does not get rid of your config. 

This is the same for your progress. The following will be saved upon death or closing the game through game menu (force closing through windows does not save): 

Putting a fuse in a fuse box (any fuses grabbed will be lost).

Turning on an electrical box.

Starting section 2 (will spawn you in section 2).

Opening the hub (will spawn you in the hub).


UV Light Environment:


To create the desired invisible ink effect, we used decal projectors and a custom shader graph that took the status of the UV light as a parameter.

When the UV light is off, the alpha channel of the material is set to 0 so that the decal is not visible.

When the UV light is turned on, the decal becomes emissive and a sphere mask is placed in the middle of the screen so that any part of the decal outside the light does not glow.

For blood, a similar shader is used; however, when the UV is off, the decal remains visible and red.


Spoilers for game puzzles:


6753 is code for section 2 door

1985 is code for hub door


Bugs:

If you open pause menu while using a note you can move around.

If you havent done section 2 and you start the elevator sequence you can go into section 2.

Audio issues with monsters.

Main menu volume lower than intended.
